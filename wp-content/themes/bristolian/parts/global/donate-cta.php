            <p><strong>Running events is expensive.</strong> From the venue hire to the raffles, each detail takes meticulous planning and preparation weeks before the meet is even announced. It's tiring, thankless, and stressful. It's expensive on the psyche, and expensive on the wallet.</p>
            <p>But hey, at least you can help out with one of them!</p>
